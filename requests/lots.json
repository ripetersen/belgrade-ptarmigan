Over his 23-season career, Aaron earned universal respect as a five-tool superstar. He remains baseball's all-time leader in RBI (2,297) and total bases (6,856), towering as a near-mythical figure still omnipresent in Major League Baseball. Aaron was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982, appearing on 406 of a possible 415 ballots. Sadly, the baseball legend passed away in January 2021.",
